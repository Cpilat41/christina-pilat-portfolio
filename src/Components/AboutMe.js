              Sustainability is a huge reason why I decided to pivot my career
              into the tech field, hoping to channel my skills as a developer
              into making a difference for a better future.

              As a creative person, I've spent of alot of time making things
              with my hands - painting, building, crocheting, writing - however,
              there is something unique about Web Developement that allows me to
              be creative in a different way. I believe there is an art or
              finese to coding that creates an insatiable need to learn and keep
              growing. That is what also drew me to coding - the knowledge that
              there is always more to learn. And I'm excited to experience it.{" "}

              I've also spent a lot of time working in various aspects of
              customer service and while that can very rewarding my biggest
              passion in life is sustainability. My goal is devote my skills to
              a cause rooted in sustainability values.

              I decided to try an online coding bootcamp after a few friends of
              mine had talked to me about their careers as web and software
              developers. So I took a short coding class with
              <a href="https://www.shecodes.io/"> SheCodes</a> just to see if
              it's something I thought I could do.
            </p>
            <p>
              When I realized how much I liked it and what could be done with
              coding, it's like the sky opened up and possibilities became
              endless. I realized I've found something so intersting and
              ever-evolving and I was hooked!
            </p>
            <p>
              After months of searching for the right bootcamp I found
              <a href="https://www.codingdojo.com/"> Coding Dojo</a>. I think
              Coding Dojo was uniquely qualified for the kind of education I was
              looking for. I was able to not only learn the material but make
              friends and join an online community I will always cherish.
